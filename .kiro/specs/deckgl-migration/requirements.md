# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a proof of concept migration of the CountryQuiz globe visualization from D3.js to Deck.gl. The goal is to demonstrate basic functionality with minimal effort to validate the performance benefits of WebGL-based rendering before committing to a full migration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a basic Deck.gl globe that can display countries, so that I can validate the technical feasibility of the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Deck.gl globe component is rendered THEN the system SHALL display a 3D globe with country boundaries
2. WHEN the component receives GeoJSON data THEN the system SHALL render all countries as polygons
3. WHEN the globe is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same geographic projection as the current D3.js implementation
4. WHEN the component is integrated THEN the system SHALL maintain the same React component props interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the selected country highlighted on the Deck.gl globe, so that the basic quiz functionality works.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a country name is passed as selectedCountry prop THEN the system SHALL highlight that country with a different color
2. WHEN the selectedCountry changes THEN the system SHALL update the highlighting immediately
3. WHEN no country is selected THEN the system SHALL display all countries with the default color
4. WHEN the selected country is found THEN the system SHALL center the globe view on that country

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want basic interaction with the Deck.gl globe, so that I can rotate and zoom like before.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user drags on the globe THEN the system SHALL rotate the globe view
2. WHEN the user scrolls with mouse wheel THEN the system SHALL zoom in and out
3. WHEN the user interacts with the globe THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations
4. WHEN the globe is rotated THEN the system SHALL maintain the country highlighting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to compare performance between D3.js and Deck.gl implementations, so that I can measure the improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both implementations are available THEN the system SHALL allow switching between them via a toggle
2. WHEN performance is measured THEN the system SHALL provide basic FPS monitoring capabilities
3. WHEN the same geographic data is loaded THEN both implementations SHALL display identical visual results
4. WHEN interactions are performed THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics for comparison

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the proof of concept to integrate seamlessly with the existing CountryQuiz, so that testing is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Deck.gl component is created THEN the system SHALL accept the same props as the current Globe component
2. WHEN the component is used in CountryQuiz THEN the system SHALL work without changes to the parent component
3. WHEN the quiz logic runs THEN the system SHALL respond to selectedCountry prop changes correctly
4. WHEN settings are applied THEN the system SHALL respect showBorders and other visual settings
