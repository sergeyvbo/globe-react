# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating an automated deployment system for the GeoQuiz application using TypeScript scripts with Node.js, Docker containerization, and GitHub Actions integration. The system should provide a seamless, reliable, and scalable deployment process that can be executed locally or through CI/CD pipelines.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: TypeScript Deployment Scripts

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use TypeScript scripts for deployment automation, so that I can leverage type safety, modern JavaScript features, and maintain consistency with the project's technology stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run deployment scripts THEN the system SHALL execute TypeScript files directly using Node.js native TypeScript support
2. WHEN I write deployment logic THEN the system SHALL provide full TypeScript type checking and IntelliSense support
3. WHEN scripts encounter errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear, typed error messages with stack traces
4. WHEN I import modules THEN the system SHALL support both ES modules and CommonJS imports
5. WHEN I use external libraries THEN the system SHALL have proper TypeScript definitions available

### Requirement 2: Docker Containerization

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the application to be fully containerized, so that I can ensure consistent deployment across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I build the application THEN the system SHALL create optimized Docker images for both frontend and backend
2. WHEN I deploy the application THEN the system SHALL use Docker Compose to orchestrate multi-container deployment
3. WHEN containers start THEN the system SHALL ensure proper networking and service discovery between containers
4. WHEN I need persistence THEN the system SHALL configure Docker volumes for database data
5. WHEN I update the application THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployments with health checks

### Requirement 3: Environment Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible environment configuration, so that I can deploy the same application to different environments (development, staging, production) with appropriate settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I deploy to different environments THEN the system SHALL load environment-specific configuration files
2. WHEN I configure secrets THEN the system SHALL securely manage sensitive data like database passwords and API keys
3. WHEN I need to override settings THEN the system SHALL support environment variable overrides
4. WHEN I validate configuration THEN the system SHALL check for required environment variables before deployment
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL restart only affected services

### Requirement 4: Database Migration and Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated database setup and migrations, so that the database schema is always in sync with the application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I deploy for the first time THEN the system SHALL automatically create and initialize the PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN I deploy updates THEN the system SHALL run pending Entity Framework migrations automatically
3. WHEN migrations fail THEN the system SHALL rollback to the previous stable state
4. WHEN I need to seed data THEN the system SHALL support running data seeding scripts
5. WHEN I backup data THEN the system SHALL provide database backup and restore capabilities

### Requirement 5: Build and Asset Management

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want optimized build processes, so that the deployed application has minimal bundle sizes and optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I build the frontend THEN the system SHALL create production-optimized React bundles with code splitting
2. WHEN I build the backend THEN the system SHALL compile .NET application with release optimizations
3. WHEN I deploy static assets THEN the system SHALL configure proper caching headers and compression
4. WHEN I update assets THEN the system SHALL handle cache invalidation automatically
5. WHEN builds fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and stop the deployment process

### Requirement 6: Health Checks and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want comprehensive health monitoring, so that I can ensure the application is running correctly after deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services start THEN the system SHALL perform health checks before marking deployment as successful
2. WHEN health checks fail THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to the previous version
3. WHEN I monitor the application THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for application health status
4. WHEN services are unhealthy THEN the system SHALL send notifications and alerts
5. WHEN I need metrics THEN the system SHALL expose basic performance and availability metrics

### Requirement 7: Local Development Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the full production-like environment locally, so that I can test deployment processes and debug issues before pushing to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run locally THEN the system SHALL support development mode with hot reloading
2. WHEN I test deployment THEN the system SHALL provide local deployment simulation
3. WHEN I debug issues THEN the system SHALL support attaching debuggers to containerized services
4. WHEN I develop features THEN the system SHALL support volume mounting for live code updates
5. WHEN I switch environments THEN the system SHALL easily switch between development and production configurations

### Requirement 8: GitHub Actions Integration

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want automated CI/CD pipelines, so that deployments happen automatically when code is pushed to specific branches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger deployment to production
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL deploy to staging environment for testing
3. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL notify the team and prevent broken deployments
4. WHEN I need to rollback THEN the system SHALL support one-click rollback to previous versions
5. WHEN I review deployments THEN the system SHALL provide deployment logs and status in GitHub

### Requirement 9: Security and Best Practices

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the deployment system to follow security best practices, so that the application and infrastructure are protected from common vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I deploy containers THEN the system SHALL use non-root users and minimal base images
2. WHEN I handle secrets THEN the system SHALL never expose sensitive data in logs or environment variables
3. WHEN I configure networking THEN the system SHALL use proper firewall rules and network segmentation
4. WHEN I update dependencies THEN the system SHALL scan for known vulnerabilities
5. WHEN I access services THEN the system SHALL enforce HTTPS and proper authentication

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a new team member, I want comprehensive documentation, so that I can understand and maintain the deployment system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup and usage instructions
2. WHEN I troubleshoot issues THEN the system SHALL include common problems and solutions
3. WHEN I need to modify scripts THEN the system SHALL have well-documented TypeScript code with comments
4. WHEN I onboard new developers THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step deployment guides
5. WHEN I maintain the system THEN the system SHALL include automated testing for deployment scripts
