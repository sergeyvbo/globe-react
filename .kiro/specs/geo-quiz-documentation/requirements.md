# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document captures the requirements for the existing React + D3.js Geo Quiz application. The application is an educational geography quiz platform that provides three distinct quiz modes: Country Quiz with interactive globe visualization, Flag Quiz with matching gameplay, and State Quiz focusing on US geography. The application supports multiple languages, difficulty levels, and includes comprehensive settings management with score tracking functionality.
