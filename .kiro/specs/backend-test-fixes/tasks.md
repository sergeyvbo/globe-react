# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create enhanced test utilities and base classes





  - Create TestDataBuilder utility class with unique timestamp and email generation
  - Create TimestampManager for preventing race conditions with timestamps
  - Create BaseUnitTest abstract class for improved unit test isolation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2, 6.1, 6.2_

- [x] 2. Enhance TestWebApplicationFactory for better database isolation





  - Implement thread-safe database name generation using counter and timestamp
  - Add improved database cleanup mechanisms with proper error handling
  - Ensure each test class gets a truly unique database instance
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 3. Improve BaseIntegrationTest with robust cleanup and initialization





  - Implement IAsyncLifetime interface for proper test lifecycle management
  - Add semaphore-based synchronization for database cleanup operations
  - Implement enhanced ClearDatabaseAsync method with proper foreign key handling
  - Add automatic authorization header cleanup between tests
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 6.4_

- [x] 4. Fix race conditions in integration tests





  - Replace DateTime.UtcNow usage with deterministic timestamp generation in LeaderboardControllerTests
  - Replace DateTime.UtcNow usage with deterministic timestamp generation in GameStatsControllerTests
  - Remove Task.Delay calls and replace with proper timestamp management
  - Ensure unique email generation for all test users
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [x] 5. Update unit tests to use enhanced base class and utilities





  - Refactor AuthServiceTests to inherit from BaseUnitTest
  - Refactor GameStatsServiceTests to inherit from BaseUnitTest
  - Refactor LeaderboardServiceTests to inherit from BaseUnitTest
  - Replace manual database setup with standardized approach
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 7.1, 7.2_

- [ ] 6. Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Add detailed error logging in database cleanup operations
  - Implement fallback database recreation when cleanup fails
  - Add informative error messages for test failures
  - Create diagnostic utilities for test debugging
  - _Requirements: 5.4, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

- [ ] 7. Analyze and address potential production race conditions
  - Review GameSession creation logic for potential race conditions
  - Review User registration process for concurrent access issues
  - Review RefreshToken handling for potential conflicts
  - Document findings and recommend production fixes if needed
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive test validation and cleanup verification
  - Write tests to verify database isolation between test classes
  - Write tests to verify proper cleanup of test data
  - Write tests to verify unique timestamp generation
  - Write tests to verify unique email generation
  - Validate that all existing tests pass with new infrastructure
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 6.1, 6.2_
