# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the React + D3.js Geo Quiz application from Create React App (CRA) to Vite. The migration aims to resolve dependency conflicts, enable updates to the latest package versions, improve development experience with faster build times, and modernize the build toolchain while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Build System Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Create React App to Vite, so that I can use modern build tooling with faster development builds and better dependency management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use Vite as the build tool instead of react-scripts
2. WHEN the development server starts THEN the system SHALL provide faster hot module replacement than CRA
3. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL generate optimized bundles that maintain application functionality
4. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing build outputs and asset handling
5. WHEN environment variables are used THEN the system SHALL properly handle Vite's environment variable conventions

### Requirement 2: Dependency Updates and Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update all dependencies to their latest versions, so that I can eliminate security vulnerabilities and use modern features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL use the latest stable versions of all packages
2. WHEN TypeScript is updated THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript 5.x without compatibility issues
3. WHEN React and related packages are updated THEN the system SHALL use React 18.x with latest features
4. WHEN Material-UI is updated THEN the system SHALL use the latest MUI v6 components
5. WHEN testing libraries are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing test functionality
6. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL have zero high-severity security vulnerabilities

### Requirement 3: Configuration and Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Vite configuration, so that the application builds and runs correctly with all existing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Vite is configured THEN the system SHALL support TypeScript compilation without additional setup
2. WHEN assets are processed THEN the system SHALL handle SVG, JSON, and image files correctly
3. WHEN the development server runs THEN the system SHALL support hash routing for GitHub Pages deployment
4. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL generate assets with correct public paths
5. WHEN environment variables are accessed THEN the system SHALL use Vite's import.meta.env instead of process.env
6. WHEN CSS is processed THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing styling functionality

### Requirement 4: Development Experience Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved development experience, so that I can work more efficiently with faster builds and better tooling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development server starts THEN the system SHALL start faster than the previous CRA setup
2. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL provide instant hot module replacement
3. WHEN TypeScript errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages in the browser
4. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL provide faster build times than CRA
5. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL maintain proper source map generation

### Requirement 5: Testing Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain all testing capabilities, so that existing tests continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL execute all existing Jest tests successfully
2. WHEN test coverage is generated THEN the system SHALL provide accurate coverage reports
3. WHEN React Testing Library tests run THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing test functionality
4. WHEN new tests are added THEN the system SHALL support modern testing patterns with Vite
5. WHEN test files are changed THEN the system SHALL provide fast test re-execution

### Requirement 6: Deployment Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain GitHub Pages deployment, so that the application continues to deploy correctly to the existing hosting platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL generate static files compatible with GitHub Pages
2. WHEN deployed to GitHub Pages THEN the system SHALL handle hash routing correctly
3. WHEN assets are loaded THEN the system SHALL use correct base paths for the deployment environment
4. WHEN the deployment script runs THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing gh-pages workflow
5. WHEN the application loads in production THEN the system SHALL function identically to the CRA version

### Requirement 7: Code Compatibility and Functionality Preservation

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing application features to work identically after migration, so that no functionality is lost during the build system change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Country Quiz loads THEN the system SHALL display the interactive globe with identical functionality
2. WHEN the Flag Quiz runs THEN the system SHALL provide the same matching game experience
3. WHEN the State Quiz operates THEN the system SHALL show the US map with identical behavior
4. WHEN settings are changed THEN the system SHALL persist and apply settings exactly as before
5. WHEN switching between quiz modes THEN the system SHALL maintain identical navigation behavior
6. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display identical UI and styling
7. WHEN D3.js visualizations render THEN the system SHALL provide identical interactive behavior

### Requirement 8: Performance and Bundle Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved application performance, so that the application loads faster and runs more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL have smaller or equivalent bundle sizes compared to CRA
2. WHEN assets are loaded THEN the system SHALL provide efficient code splitting and lazy loading
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve runtime performance
4. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL generate optimized and minified assets
5. WHEN caching is applied THEN the system SHALL provide efficient browser caching strategies
